# reflexiondeclase

The class was interesting, although I did not understand very much about it, since I am not really good at programming. I think we should have seen more basic programming topics first, and then get to the problem situations. Since the class is not really long, we should also had seen more beginner-friendly exercises so that everyone could be in the same page.
